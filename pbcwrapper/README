THE PBC WRAPPER CLASSES LIBARY

Ben Lynn has developed the pairing-based cryptography (PBC) library,
which implements the important primitives for pairing-based
cryptography. The PBC library is developed in C over the gmp
library. For more information about the PBC library, please refer to the
PBC webpage.

I recently developed C++ wrapper classes for the PBC library for our
distributed key generation project. Here, I am making available a
library of these classes (released under the GNU Public License) for
anybody to use.

Note that this C++ library does not modify the underling PBC library. My
sole aim is to make the C++ development based on the PBC library more
comfortable. As a salient feature of these wrapper classes, to improve
the code readability, we have included operator overloading.

USAGE: 
This version is compatible with at least version 0.5.6 of the PBC library.

- First, install the PBC library as described here and set the library
path as described here. After that, decompress this wrapper class
library and install it by calling make inside the PBCWrapper-x.y.z
directory.

- While using this wrapper classes library, please use the header (*.h)
files to obtain the class declarations. Most of these declarations
should be self-explanatory. For sample code, please see Testing.cc
included in the PBCWrapper-x.y.z directory.

- Also, I did not write C++ functions for parameter generation. Use the
excutables or the source codes in the gen subdirectory of the pbc-x.y.z
directory to create a parameter file.
